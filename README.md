Greeting all of you to my Github Repositories, in this repo, sometimes you will find something fun, sometimes a little bit absurd. But, thank you for the visit!
---

This Github Repo is devoted to save (and also showcase) all my projects troughout my programming life. I love being organize, in every project I want it to be perfect and as organize as I could, even in a very small detail. This means every project that I evolved in is mostly and must be organize using somekind of agreement before the project started. 

Git is the most useful tool that I know these day to organize a project and Github is so awesome. As also a Graphic Designer, I like to think in structuric and aesthetic ways of thinking and Github provides me as a platform with the awesome design and features that Github offers and it keeps going! So proud of being one in this community.

Anyways, if you need me as any kind of business purpose, feel free to contact me on [thomiaditya@email.com](mailto:thomiaditya@email.com) and let me see what I could do for you.
