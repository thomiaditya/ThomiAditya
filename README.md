## Greeting all of you to my Github Repositories! I've got a little bit of everything here, from the serious to the absurd.

This ***Github Repo*** is devoted to save (and also showcase) all my projects troughout my programming life. I'm all about being organized, down to even the smallest detail. That's why I make sure that every project I work on is well-planned and structured from the beginning. 

***Git*** is an essential tool for me, and ***Github*** is just an awesome platform that combines functionality and style. As a graphic designer, I really appreciate that! And I'm thrilled to be part of this amazing community.

Anyways, if you have any business inquiries or just want to say hi, feel free to email me at [thomiaditya@gmail.com](mailto:thomiaditya@gmail.com). Thanks for visiting!
